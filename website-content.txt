Title: Our Services
Subtitle: Comprehensive paediatric occupational therapy solutions tailored to your child's needs

--- INTRODUCTION ---
Our specialist paediatric occupational therapy services are designed to help children develop essential skills, overcome developmental challenges, and participate fully in daily activities at home, school, and in the community.

--- MAIN SERVICES ---

Service 1: Sensory Integration Therapy
Many children experience difficulties processing sensory information from their environment. Our sensory integration therapy helps children who are over-responsive (sensory sensitive) or under-responsive (sensory seeking) to sensory input. Through play-based activities and structured interventions, we help children regulate their sensory systems, improve attention and focus, reduce anxiety, and participate more fully in daily activities. We also provide sensory strategies and environmental modifications for home and school settings.

Service 2: Fine Motor Skills Development
Fine motor skills are essential for handwriting, drawing, cutting, buttoning, and many other daily tasks. We provide comprehensive assessments and targeted interventions to develop hand strength, finger dexterity, hand-eye coordination, and bilateral coordination. Our therapy includes activities to improve pencil grasp, handwriting legibility, scissor skills, and manipulation of small objects. We work closely with schools to support children's success in classroom activities.

Service 3: Self-Care and Daily Living Skills
Building independence in self-care activities is a crucial part of child development. We support children in developing skills for dressing, eating, grooming, toileting, and other essential daily activities. Our interventions address underlying skill deficits, provide adaptive strategies, and recommend appropriate equipment when needed. We work collaboratively with families to establish routines and strategies that promote independence at home and school.

Service 4: School Readiness and Academic Support
Preparing children for the demands of school requires a range of developmental skills. We assess and support pre-academic skills including attention, sitting tolerance, following instructions, visual-motor integration, and early literacy skills. For school-aged children, we address challenges with handwriting, organization, attention in the classroom, and participation in school activities. We provide recommendations for classroom accommodations and work collaboratively with teachers to support each child's success.
